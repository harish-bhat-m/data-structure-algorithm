# Data-Structure-Algorithm

The reposiotory will include the problem solution related to the data structure and algorithms. It also include some of the implemtation of sorting, search algorithms. The mail aim of the this repository is simplify the some of the solutions for data structre and algorithms problems.

Implemented in Python Programming Langauage version 3.

Below are the list of problems and descriptions

| Problem | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| Currency Denomination | You have give the currency notes/coins of denomination 2000, 500, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1. Write a program  to display the different combination of currencies with the number for given amount of rupees |
| Balalced bracket check in an expression | Given an string expression, write a program to examine whether the pairs and the orders of “(“, “)” are correct in exp. |
| Graph Implementation | Graph Implementation, adjecenncy list, breadth first traversal. etc. |
| Palindrome Test | Given an string expression, write a program to examine whether the pairs and the orders of “(“, “)” are correct in exp. |
| Pascal Triangle | Implementation of Pascal or Pingala triangle. |
| Binary Tree implementation | Simple Binary Tree implementation |
| Sorting algorithms | Implementation of various sorting algorithms |
| Light and Switch Problem | There are 100 lights in a huge room. A switch panel outside the room has 100 switches each corresponding to one light in the room. But none of the switches or lights are labelled, so it's extremely difficult to identify which switch turns on which light. You are standing outside of the room... and your task is to map each switch to its corresponding light using a marker pen. You have to do this mapping in minimum number of trips to the room.Initially, all the switches are turned off.What's the minimum number of times you need to enter the room to complete the mapping of each switch to its corresponding light.|
