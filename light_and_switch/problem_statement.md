# Problem Statement

There are 100 lights in a huge room. A switch panel outside the room has 100 switches each corresponding to one light in the room. But none of the switches or lights are labelled, so it's extremely difficult to identify which switch turns on which light. You are standing outside of the room... and your task is to map each switch to its corresponding light using a marker pen. You have to do this mapping in minimum number of trips to the room.Initially, all the switches are turned off.What's the minimum number of times you need to enter the room to complete the mapping of each switch to its corresponding light.
