Consider a string "abBba" here we need to check if there any changes in the character.
If there is change in the character we need to get the count of the chnage.
Example: In the above string, the count is 2. Character 'a' to 'b' is the first change
the 'b' to 'B' is not the change, then 'B' to 'b' is not the change, then 'b' to 'a' 
is the second change. We do not consider the case sensitivity here.
